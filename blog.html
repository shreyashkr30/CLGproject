                <h1>Do Car pOOl launches 11 Food/Refreshment Centers in Howrah</h1> <br>
                <p>The summer wave is sweeping over India and has been taking a toll on the health of everyone around
                    us. Do Car pOOl is highly concerned for the health of its captains who brave the sun throughout the
                    day
                    so that the customers reach their destinations quickly and safely. To replenish the energy of its
                    captains, Do Car pOOl has taken an initiative to launch 11 refreshment and food centers throughout
                    Bangalore.
                    These centers shall provide healthy and nutritious food & juices at highly subsidized rates so that
                    the captains don't have to burn a hole in their pockets, every time they feel famished after a
                    hectic shift on the bike. The whole procedure is as simple as A-B-C. All they have to do is walk in
                    to any of the centers, show their meal voucher in the Do Car pOOl Captain Application/SMS and get
                    their
                    food/refreshments! Utmost care is taken to ensure that the quality of the food/refreshments in these
                    centers is good
                    CENTERS:It gives the Do Car pOOl team immense satisfaction that this initiative is very well
                    accepted and liked
                    by our captains. Each captain is important to us and we owe our success to them. They are not just
                    small dots on the map but our business partners without whom there can be no Do Car pOOl. This is
                    just a
                    small step in the direction of building a great partnership that will change the way India travels
                    in the future!

                <h1>Do Car pOOl rolls out its Power Pass Subscription Program</h1> <br>
                <p>India's largest CAR taxi service, Do Car pOOl has launched its Power pass subscription program to
                    make
                    the daily commute more economical for its users. With the subscription, users can avail huge
                    benefits on all their rides. Also, Pass users will be able to book their rides without any surge
                    pricing levied on flat fares. What differentiates the Power pass from the other subscription
                    programs is that the in-house
                    developed tool suggests only one best suited pass for every individual user by analyzing the user's
                    riding frequency and average riding distance.“We understand that every user is different and has
                    unique preferences, which motivated us to develop one of a kind solution to cater to their needs.
                    Our tool understands the user's behavior and provides the best suited pass rather than showing
                    multiple passes and confusing them” Says Hiran Gunasekaran, Head Power Pass,Do Car pOOl.The
                    subscription option has been rolled out to a limited set of customers across a few cities in India
                    but it is expected to be made available to all Do Car pOOl customers in the coming months.Do Car
                    pOol claims that the pass users are able to save up to 40% on their travel spendings. Also, the
                    company claims that the pass users are riding 60% more frequently when compared to other users.Do
                    Car pOOl aims to have 1 million active pass users by June 2020.</p>

                <h1>Do Car pOOl takes the spotlight at popular co-working spaces in Patna</h1> <br>
                <p>Co-working spaces have created a niche ecosystem in the start-up industry.
                    Last week, Do Car pOOl marked its presence in innovative co-working spaces like GoWork, Springboard,
                    GoHive, Ikeva and The Office Pass by organising a customer registration drive at these sprawling
                    campuses.People generally look at discovering ways and means to avoid peak hour congestion. But
                    then, the chance of finding a four-wheeler cab service on time is a rare phenomenon. Not only that,
                    the skyrocketing fares only seem to aggravate the problem. Even if you give three-wheelers a try,
                    you basically end up spending more time haggling about ride fares with the driver.Riding on a Do Car
                    pOOl
                    can reduce traffic congestion related worries. With a quick-fix solution, Do Car pOOl provides
                    economical
                    rides that don't burn a hole in your pocket.The news about Do Car pOOl spread through word-of-mouth
                    and fell from one ear to the other. This dynamic
                    interaction saw 900+ on-the-spot registrations.</p>

                <h1>Breaking gender stereotypes</h1> <br>
                <p>Achieving a gender-equal world starts by making sure women's needs/experiences are well integrated in
                    the field of technology and innovations. Do Car pOOl believes that women can make a huge impact and
                    here
                    we give a big shout out to one of our woman captain - Manjula who started off her journey with
                    Do Car pOOl as recent as last week and has gained popularity already.A 23 year old, based out of
                    Bangalore - Manjula joined Do Car pOOl as a Captain on October 30, and on her very first day
                    completed 7
                    rides. On meeting her and checking with her how she manages to be a female Car rider in today's
                    world which is predominantly male dominated when it comes to deliveries, driving cabs etc, she
                    expresses how important being independent is for her and why more number of females should be doing
                    this. She further tells that she had great interactions with the customers and is also loving her
                    job. Many of the pillion riders are actually very impressed with her professionalism and her
                    navigation skills already.</p>
